# Design-of-graph-processors-using-graph-algorithms
The project "Design of Graph Processors Using Graph Algorithms" involves the development and optimization of specialized hardware, known as graph processors, for efficiently executing graph algorithms. Graph algorithms are computational procedures that operate on graph structures, which consist of nodes connected by edges.
